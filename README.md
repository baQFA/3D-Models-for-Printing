# 3D-Models-for-Printing
A collection of models for printing with a 3D printer to improve life and work with BaQFA.

## Pipette Grid Template
This tool helps you to pipette 3µl droplets of your bacterial suspension into a neat grid on the agar plate for more consistent results and makes the whole replica plating and plating tool obsolete.
Highly recommended to use a multichannel pipette along with it (leave every second pipette tip away to get a chessboard pattern for competitive fitness measures).
Instructions on how to use this with the BaQFA Android setup can be found on [baqfa.org](https://www.baqfa.org/).


## Plating Tool 

**This is only needed if you are using the Replica Plater!** Consider switching to the pipette template with a multichannel pipette for more consistent results. 

If you are still using the Sigma Replica Plater, the plating tool will help with consistent plating of 96 culture spots on agar for baQFA, using:

- Sigma R2508 Replica Plater
- Thermo Scientific™ Nunc™ MicroWell™ 96-Well Microplates
- Thermo Scientific™ Nunc™ OmniTray™ Single-Well Plate


For assembly, two 10mm diameter rods of 200mm length are needed (ideally stainless steel or aluminium). 
To fix the rods in place:
   1. Use a 1.6mm drill bit to drill through the designated rod fixing holes into the metal rod.
   2. Take out the rods and use a 2mm drill bit to make the holes in the metal slightly larger.
   3. Use a 28mm piece of 3D printing filament (1.75mm) and stick it through the holes in the plating tool base and the metal rod to fix the rods in place
   4. Don't use any glue or heat to fix the filament if you want to be able to disassemble the plater tool in the future
   
Coming soon: magnetic caps to keep the plater fixed at the top of the metal rods to make it easier when swapping plates.


## BaQFA Plate holder

A comfortable holder for Thermo Scientific™ Nunc™ OmniTray™ Single-Well Plates to keep the plate from moving when using the Lego Mindstorms robot to open and close the plate lid for time series photographs.
